Creating a website using Github
===============================

Step 1: Create Repository
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Create an empty repository on Github with the name ``<username>.github.io``.

i.e if your username is jsmith, then you create a repository called jsmith.github.io

Make sure that this repository is public. The name of this repository will also be the url to the website. i.e. https://jsmith.github.io

Step 2: Find a website template
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
You could write your own html and css if you like. But there are plenty of templates out there so you don't have to. My favourite are from: https://html5up.net/

Shell Tips and Tricks

Adam, @abatten: `cd -`
Using `cd -` will take you back to the last directory you were in.
This is good for changing between two directories.

Renee, @respiewak: `grep -A NUM`
If you're interested in a few lines of a file _following_ a particular
keyword, using `grep -A NUM` is your best bet. The opposite is
`grep -B NUM`, to show lines before the matching line.
